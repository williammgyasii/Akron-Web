Yes, that makes perfect sense! Here’s how you can structure the app:

### **App Structure Overview**

1. **Groups**: 
   - A group is the top-level entity.
   - Users must be part of a group to interact with it.

2. **Projects**:
   - Projects belong to a group.
   - Each project can have multiple tasks.
   - Users can only create or interact with tasks if they are part of a group and have access to the specific project within that group.

3. **Tasks**:
   - Tasks are the smallest unit and belong to a project.
   - Only users who are part of the project (and thus the group) can create, view, or manage tasks.

### **Workflow**

1. **User Joins a Group**:
   - A user must first be added to a group.
   - This could be done by an admin or by the user being invited.

2. **Create a Project in the Group**:
   - Once a user is part of a group, they can create or be assigned to projects within that group.
   - Projects serve as containers for tasks and define specific scopes within the group.

3. **Task Management within a Project**:
   - Tasks can only be created under a project.
   - Users assigned to the project can create, view, and manage tasks.

### **Firestore Data Structure**

- **Groups Collection**:
  ```plaintext
  /groups/{groupId}
  ```
  - **Fields**:
    - `groupName`: Name of the group.
    - `members`: Array of user IDs who are part of the group.
    - `createdAt`: Timestamp of when the group was created.

- **Projects Subcollection** (inside a group):
  ```plaintext
  /groups/{groupId}/projects/{projectId}
  ```
  - **Fields**:
    - `projectName`: Name of the project.
    - `description`: Description of the project.
    - `createdAt`: Timestamp of when the project was created.
    - `members`: Array of user IDs who are part of the project.

- **Tasks Subcollection** (inside a project):
  ```plaintext
  /groups/{groupId}/projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}
  ```
  - **Fields**:
    - `taskTitle`: Title of the task.
    - `taskDescription`: Description of the task.
    - `dueDate`: The due date of the task.
    - `createdBy`: User ID of the creator.
    - `assignedTo`: User ID(s) to whom the task is assigned.
    - `status`: Status of the task (e.g., Pending, Completed).

### **Key Considerations**

- **Authorization**: Ensure that users can only see and interact with the groups, projects, and tasks they are part of.
- **UI/UX**: 
  - Display groups a user is part of.
  - Within each group, show the projects.
  - Within each project, display tasks.
- **Scalability**: This structure will scale as you add more features, such as different roles within a project (e.g., Admin, Contributor, Viewer).

### **Next Steps**

1. **Create Projects Feature**:
   - Start by allowing users to create projects within a group.
   - Include fields like project name, description, and members.

2. **Bind Tasks to Projects**:
   - When creating tasks, ensure they are linked to a specific project.
   - Only users who are members of the project can manage tasks.

3. **UI Development**:
   - Develop UI components that reflect this hierarchy: Groups → Projects → Tasks.

This approach provides a clear hierarchy and makes it easier to manage permissions and data flow within the app.
